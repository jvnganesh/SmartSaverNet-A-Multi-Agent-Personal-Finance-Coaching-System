# Policy
Centralized rules for category mapping, alert thresholds, and guardrails.
Your agents/tools should read these to stay consistent and safe.

Files:
- spend_categories.yaml  — category taxonomy + keyword matching
- thresholds.yaml        — limits (min savings rate, overspend caps, etc.)
- guardrails.yaml        — refusal rules and restricted topics
- message_templates.yaml — reusable user-facing phrasing
